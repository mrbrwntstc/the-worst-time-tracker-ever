Literally, the worst time tracker ever

### Time in
Input the time you came in at work. This label won't do anything if the time in is past the current time

### Lunch break
- If you're inputting minutes, simply put how many minutes were out for lunch. If you were out for 20 minutes then put 20.00,
  then put the combo box to minute(s).
- If you're inputting hours, the decimal number of hours is the decimal percentage of minutes. For example, if you were out for
  an hour and 20 minutes, then you would put 1.3 in the box, then change the combo box to hour(s).
  
### Calculate Time and Reset
- After putting in all the times, click "Calculate time" and it'll give you the progress bar and tell you if it's time to go
  home. This is for a 9 hour shift since I'm on a 9/80 work schedule.
- If you want to start over, simply click the "Reset" button.
